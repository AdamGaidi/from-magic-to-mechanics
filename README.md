Recommended resources for learning about GPU programming and the WebGPU API

### How to use this list
Everyone has their own set of preferences when learning something new. They vary depending on interests, preferred medium, and available time. Your preferences may also vary depending on the time of the year, or maybe even the day of the week. Personally I enjoy a kind of "all-over-the-place"-approach while building a high-level superficial understanding. I recommend doing a mix of deeper theory, some practical coding and in general using the materials that best align with your interests. Perhaps you're excited by captivating visuals, geometry and linear algebra, then graphics programming and shader art are likely to be motivating topics to frame your learning. Maybe you are deeply interested in the computational power a GPU can give you. In that case, CUDA and heavy computations in general would be perfect. Personally I find both to be very thrilling, and would recommend reading up on a little bit of everything to find what best excites you. 

The order I would learn things would probably be something like
- Start with something bite-sized and practical, for example [Your first WebGPU app](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/your-first-webgpu-app#0)
- After getting a feel for how it is in practice, I'd try to read some articles to better understand what I just did
- Try to write some code
- Watch one of the videos with some visual components to get a feel for the entire pipeline
- Try to write some code
- Watch the video on how CUDA Programming works
- Try to write some code
- Try to briefly explore deeper resources; Books and academic-level courses
- Try to write some code
- Focus on what I find to be the most interesting
- Try to write some code
